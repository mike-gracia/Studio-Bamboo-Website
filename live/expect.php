        <h2> New to Yoga? </h2>
		Yoga, by its nature, is very challenging yet it is not a contest or race. In fact, there is no room for ego in classes. Doing yoga correctly means paying attention to your breath and your body. It doesn't matter what anyone else is doing, only you. You will find benefits of each class no matter how strong and flexible you are or are not. As long as you are feeling the posture and at the same time maintaining a slow, even, and flowing breath your are practicing correctly. 
<br /> <br />
In the beginning, don't push yourself too hard. Yoga shouldn't cause you pain (even two days later). It is a lifelong practice, so really, there is no need to be in a rush. This practice encourages you to begin slowly, practice regularly, breathe deeply, pay attention, and build on the small gradual changes you observe as you progress.feet.
