		<h1> 500 Hour Program </h1>
			To be eligible for the 500-hour certification students  will need to have already completed a Yoga Alliance certification at the 200-hour level.
Studio Bamboo Institute of Yoga Teacher Training has changed the advanced training to a series of modules.  Students are able to choose the modules that are of most interest to their particular field of study and the ones that best fit their schedule. 
Modules can be from 2-5 days long many are often over a 3 day weekend. They are facilitated by one of our teacher training instructors or a guest master. In addition to the required modules, students decide which particular module they wish to take, at what time and taught by whom. Students can take up to three years to complete the 500 hour certification.
<br /> <br />
New 500 hour dates coming soon.
