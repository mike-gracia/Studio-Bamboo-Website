We can offer yoga classes in the workplace (if space available), yoga in chairs, one time seminars, special day long seminars for total well being, weekend retreats, and many more possibilities.

Private Classes
The study of yoga began as a dialog between teacher and student. Studio Bamboo honors that tradition by offering Private Yoga Instruction for individual students or small groups. This is a great way to meet your individual needs for that body-mind connection, relaxation and stress management. We recommend private instruction for those who are new to yoga, those with injuries or specific limitations, or for those who wish to have a specialized consultation regarding your yoga practice. These sessions may take place in the Center or off-site. Privates can be scheduled as one-on-one, duets, or semi-privates. Studio Bamboo wants you to have the best experience possible so choosing the right teacher is important, let us help. With time and location, rates vary, please call or e-mail to inquire.

One-on-one sessions begin at $65 per hour 
Duets begin at $40 per person per hour
For additional people or small groups please call to inquire
