			We ask that you arrive at least 15 minutes prior to your first practice. This will give you
			time to finish registration forms, have a staff member give you a tour of the Center, get
			settled, and have any questions answered.
			When you arrive please remove your shoes and place them in the shoe cubbies in the reception
			area. Socks are fine until practice begins, practice is done in bare feet.
