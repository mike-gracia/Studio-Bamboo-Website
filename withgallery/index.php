				<h1> Welcome</h1>
	Welcome to Studio Bamboo Institute of Yoga and Teacher Training School located in the Marina Shores Shoppes
	in Virginia Beach, Virginia. Studio Bamboo is committed to providing our community the most enriching and
	informative yoga program available. Our instructional staff is dedicated to providing an unparalleled 
	experience in yoga.
	Studio Bamboo is a spacious and tranquil Yoga Center, offering three rooms for practice, a beautiful retail
	and sitting space, and restrooms including showers. Our interior was designed specifically to step away from
	the hustle and bustle of our busy world. When you step into the Center you will immediately feel taken away
